/**
 * @class SPExporter SPExporter.m
 *
 * @author Stuart Connolly http://stuconnolly.com/
 *
 * This class is designed to be the base class of all data exporters and provide basic functionality
 * common to each of them. Each data exporter (i.e. CSV, SQL, XML, etc.) should be implemented as a subclass
 * of this class, with the end result being a modular export architecture separated by export type. All exporters
 * should also have an associated delegate protocol and delegate category (of SPExportController) which conforms
 * to this protocol.
 *
 * All export functionality is initially controlled by SPExportController, which is the single point within the
 * architecture that controls the user interface and provides user feedback. When the user starts an export 
 * operation after selecting the available options, SPExportController should create an instance of the appropriate
 * exporter (e.g. SPCSVExporter for a CSV export, etc) and begin the export process. Any available progress information
 * (defined in SPExporter as it's common to all exporters) of the export should be set by the exporter and made 
 * available to SPExportController via delegate methods in order to update the user interface.
 *
 * Note that all exporters are designed to be run concurrently and as such this base class is a subclass of 
 * NSOperation. All the data format specific subclasses have to do is override NSOperation's main() method
 * and implement all processes which are to be run concurrently within it. This method is automatically called
 * once the exporter instance is placed on the operation queue once its ready to be run. It should not be
 * explicity called.
