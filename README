BUILDING SEQUEL PRO
-------------------

Sequel Pro has no external dependencies or Interface Builder plugins, so building is
fairly straightforward.

However, we are curently targetting 10.5 as a minimum version (not for much longer!),
so the Base SDK is set to 10.5 to correctly report warnings.  Xcode 4 does not ship
with the 10.5 SDK; to install them:
 1) Find a copy of Xcode 3.  If you do not have this installed, it is still available
	from http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3__final/xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg .
 2) Install or extract the 10.5 SDK (and the 10.6 SDK for use soon...).  These would normally
	have been installed to /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk and MacOSX10.6.sdk .
 3) Copy, or symlink them, into <your Xcode.app>/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs .

After performing these steps 10.5- and 10.6-base SDKs should compile correctly (although
without PPC support).


For assistance please jump onto IRC and join #sequel-pro on irc.freenode.net and any of the 
developers will be more than happy to help you out.
